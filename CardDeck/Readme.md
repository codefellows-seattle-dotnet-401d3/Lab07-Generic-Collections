## Generics A Card Deck
Part of Our class today we learned about enums and declaring lists within classes. This is a project that builds upon setting up 
enums v/ type of card and enums s/ type of orientation. Using Object constructor we create a deck of cards that is viewed in the console.

## Overview
In C# the generics list of cards should be able to show cards, and shuffle cards. The deck is built out using the system.generics libary. Then we call a method() remove or Random() onto the cards which gives us either a random card or removes 2 cards.
